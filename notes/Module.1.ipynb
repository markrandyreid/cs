    "\n",
    "### Key Definitions:\n",
    "- **Max Tegmark**: AI is “intelligence that is not biological.”\n",
    "- **John McCarthy**: AI is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines.\n",
    "- **Nils J. Nilsson**: AI involves making machines intelligent—able to function appropriately and with foresight in their environment.\n",
    "- **Rodney Brooks**: AI is not a single entity but a collection of practices and components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "- AI mimics human intelligence through software.\n",
    "- It's a broad field that involves problem-solving, adaptability, and the creation of intelligent behavior in machines.\n",
    "- AI includes various tools and methods assembled to make machines “think” like humans.\n"
