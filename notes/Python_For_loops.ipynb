This includes not only the actual execution of the program's instructions but also program initialization, memory allocation, input/output operations, waiting for user inputs, and cleanup tasks after execution. Runtime is a broader concept encompassing the whole lifecycle from the moment the program starts executing until it terminates, including environment and system interactions.\n",
